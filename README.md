# Project Portal

Link to the Airtable: https://airtable.com/tblGGysdQuun6M4mI/viw67jOefyUpvWNJN?blocks=hide

### Gatsby theme integrated with [Airtable](https://airtable.com/)

## ðŸš€ Getting started

Install [Node package manager (NPM)](https://nodejs.org/) (if you haven't already).

### Get the source code and install dependencies.

```
$ npm install
```

### Set up Airtable API keys

Create a `.env` file in the `sites/<site id>` directory you want to develop on and fill it with your unique values:

```
AIRTABLE_API_KEY=""
AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=""
```

You can find your API key and Base ID by clicking "Help" and then "API Documentation".

You're now ready to go. If you want to customize the Airtable base, please refer to [`gatsby-source-airtable` plugin documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-airtable/).

### Data update

The data from Airtable **does not** update automatically, even when you're running the `develop` process.

If you modified any data in your Airtable base, please be sure to restart the development process, so the new data can be downloaded.

## Crucial Commands

This project comes with a few handy commands for linting and code fixing. The most important ones are the ones to develop and ship code. You can find the most important commands below.

#### `gatsby develop:<site id>`

Run in the project locally.

#### `gatsby build:<site id>`

Run a production build into `./public`. The result is ready to be put on any static hosting you prefer.

**Note:** Sometimes webpack's dev and prod builds don't quite align. If you're seeing an issue on a production build, consider using this command to build the production website locally and then running `gatsby serve` to view it.

## Architecture Description for Project Portal

At a high-level, this is a static site which:

- Overlays configuration for specific sites/deployments
- Hosts content on [Airtable](https://airtable.com)
- Builds using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com)
- Utilizes [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- Is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)
- Collects form information on Netlify and pushes that information back to Airtable

### Site configuration

Each site (deployment) has a folder named by its site id in the `sites` directory. See [the sites README](sites/README.md) for details on how to configure a site.

### Airtable

Currently there are three Airtable bases that are used throughout this project. The first
two describe all the content on the site (the projects and all contacts) and third second
tracks all form submissions.

An important fact about each project is that its _slug_ must be unique. This will be
enforced by the Airtable eventually, but it is currently ignored due to development
concerns.

### Gatsby

The basic layout of the site is to provide a series of card-based layouts, one for
each kind of project as described in the Airtable.

Currently there are three types of projects:

- Open (`src/pages/index.tsx`),
- Ongoing (`src/pages/ongoing.tsx`), and
- Completed (`src/pages/completed.tsx`).

The latter two types of projects will only appear on the Navbar if there are actually
any projects of that type.

In each case, these pages are built by the `ProjectPage` (`src/components/ProjectPage.tsx`)
component. This component automatically takes the return from a graphql query which is
filtered by the project type and then displays the projects as cards.

Each individual project detail page is generated in the `gatsby-node.js` file, though
this is just a thin shell around the `createPages` hook `src/hooks/createPages.ts`.
Note that the relevant graphql query is:

```graphql
{
  allAirtable(filter: { table: { eq: "${tableName}" } }) {
    nodes {
      data {
        slug
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In particular, note again that the _slug must be unique_ or else the pages will clobber
each other. Each project detail page is then just a rendering of the `ProjectDetail`
template (`src/templates/ProjectDetail.tsx`).

#### Some things to keep in mind

In general, avoid placing images in `static` and instead favor `src/images`. These
images may then be processed in a graphql query with sharp for, e.g., cutting down on
size, providing webpack suffices, and so forth.

If the build fails for some reason, there's a high chance it's a gatsby cache problem.
Try running `npm run clean`.

### Tailwind

The vast majority of the CSS is provided in the JSX by Tailwind CSS classes. Primary
color schemes are described in `src/styles/tailwind.presets.js` (though this is a work in progress).

#### Some things to keep in mind

`purgecss` will attempt to remove unused CSS classes from the production build. However,
some CSS classes are only used in dynamically generated content, and so `purgecss` may
miss them. If something like this occurs, please utilize the `safelist` in the Tailwind
CSS config.

If you make any changes to the CSS, please make sure to test the site with at least
a narrow media format (e.g., a phone) and a wide media format (e.g., a desktop).

### Netlify

We use Netlify's github integration to manage builds.

- Production builds are triggered upon a push/merge to the `prod` branch
- Staging builds are triggered upon a push/merge to the `main` branch
- Preview builds are triggered upon a pull request to either `main` or `prod`

We are currently investigating how to trigger a build upon certain Airtable actions.

### Forms (Netlify + Zapier + Airtable)

We are using Netlify's built in [Forms](https://docs.netlify.com/forms/setup/?_ga=2.154814840.1787923700.1636648625-1173918369.1635907455)
product. Submissions to these forms are then stored in the Airtable workspace associated
with the project using [Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/airtable/integrations/netlify).

We note that this Zapier automation piece shouldn't be necessary long term, but it's
cheap for now and reduces engineering effort for v1.

### Netlify CMS

In order to run the Netlify CMS locally, there are two steps required (rather than just one without the CMS):

1. Start the Netlify CMS proxy server. We use a different port number for each of the sites' proxies, so that all the sites can be run in parallel if required.
2. Start the Gatsby Development site itself.

In order to do this in one command, use the one-liners listed below. These spawn two processes in parallel â€“ the first is the proxy server, and the second is the development server. Both will stop together if the terminal window is sent the terminate signal. 
- Example:
  ```shell
  (export PORT=8081; cd project-portal-example && npx netlify-cms-proxy-server) | yarn develop --port 8001
  ```
- NC:
  ```shell
  (export PORT=8082; cd project-portal-nc && npx netlify-cms-proxy-server) | yarn develop:nc --port 8002
  ```
- SATX: 
  ```shell
  (export PORT=8083; cd project-portal-satx && npx netlify-cms-proxy-server) | yarn develop:satx --port 8003
  ```

In order to do this using the WebStorm run-configurations, you need to run two consecutive configurations: 
1. Start the proxy server, e.g. `netlify-cms-proxy-server:example`
2. Start the development server, e.g. `netlify-cms-proxy-server:example`

There are also Compound configurations to run these pairs of commands, e.g., `cms-proxy & develop: example`.

A run configuration to start all required proxy servers and the run the sites is included as `cms-proxy & develop: all`.
