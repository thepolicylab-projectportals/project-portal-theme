### Create Airtable base

To use this project you have to have a Airtable account.

Once you have it, go to [this base](https://airtable.com/shrlYuICEwEdAUir3) and click `Copy base` button located in the top right corner.

Included columns:

- `name` (single line text)
- `slug` (single line text, should be unique)
- `summary` (single line text)
- `image` (attachment)
- `descrition` (long text)
- `country` (single select)
- `tags` (multiple select)

### Set up Airtable API keys

Copy included `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill it with your unique values:

```
AIRTABLE_API_KEY=""
AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=""
AIRTABLE_TABLE_NAME="Destinations"
```

You can find your API key and Base ID by clicking "Help" and then "API Documentation". Table name in the example is "Destinations" (case sensitive name).

You're now ready to go. If you want to customize the Airtable base, please refer to [`gatsby-source-airtable` plugin documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-airtable/).

### Data update

The data from Airtable **does not** update automatically, even when you're running the `develop` process.

If you modified any data in your Airtable base, please be sure to restart the development process, so the new data can be downloaded.
