# Completely empty site with defaults

A usage of
[gatsby-theme-project-portal](https://github.com/thepolicylab-projectportals/project-portal-theme)
that does nothing but use the theme. As a result you will see `Error: Missing resources for /` when navigating to `http://localhost:8000`. To get rid of that, create a page in `src/pages/index.js`.
