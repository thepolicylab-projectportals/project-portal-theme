purpose: Following the July 2020* tax deadline, taxpayers who failed to pay on time received one of the three designs. NCDOR has been tracking responses for each of the three designs. This data can be used to determine which of the designs is most effective at eliciting response.\n\n*The deadline for filing 2019 taxes was delayed from April 15 to July in 2020.
question: How can NCDOR improve and simplify communications to North Carolina residents?

keyDates: This opportunity closes September 30, 2022.
deliverable: Analysis of the data from insert responses has the potential to Â  reveal whether there are patterns in the responses and if one version has been most effective. Updated inserts based on findings from the tax year 2020 analysis. Improving the response rate for late taxpayers means reducing the time and money the state invests to resolve these cases and increasing public benefits to North Carolinians as the revenues are then invested into public services.
summary: When a person or business does not pay their taxes on time, they receive a paper mailer from the North Carolina Department of Revenue (NCDOR) containing both a collection notice and an insert about past due taxes. The inserts are meant to motivate the taxpayer to action, but the team at the Taxpayer Assistance and Collection Division at NCDOR had a hunch the inserts were overdue for an overhaul.
