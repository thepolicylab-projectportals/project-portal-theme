  **The NC Department of Secretary of State ([NC SOS](https://www.sosnc.gov/)) and the NC Office of Strategic Partnerships ([OSP](https://www.osbm.nc.gov/operational-excellence/nc-office-strategic-partnerships)) are hosting a research partnership meeting on Thursday, June 30, 1:00pm-2:15pm via Teams to discuss this project. Please email the project point of contact to receive an invitation to this virtual meeting.**

  The NC Department of the Secretary of State (NC SOS) is charged with promoting economic growth and protecting the public from financial harm. NC SOS has a wide range of administrative data related to North Carolinaâ€™s charity system, corporations system, trademarks, uniform commercial code system, and tax liens system (see example data dictionaries below).

  NC SOS seeks help identifying (and ultimately implementing) research projects with its administrative data that can inform how NC SOS pursues its mission. Preliminary meetings with researchers will be an opportunity to discover what is the available data and to jointly brainstorm what priority questions might be answered with those data.

  As examples of available administrative data, consider the following Public Data Export Table Documentation files:
  - [NC Charity System](https://ncosbm.sharefile.com/d-s656654b4076f4dfc9a62a15983e2a04e)
  - [NC Corporations System](https://ncosbm.sharefile.com/d-se35dbd6786f34da18a73b0841ce5b870)
  - [NC Tax Liens System](https://ncosbm.sharefile.com/d-sbaf1e4856225457ca180d868f54c74be)
  - [NC Trademarks System](https://ncosbm.sharefile.com/d-s593017348eee466b8ee12443169c60fe)
  - [NC Uniform Commercial Code System](https://ncosbm.sharefile.com/d-sf61162e3240f477baf1e3564967f5f49)

  Those are examples of available data; NC SOS has other data, and research projects may also benefit from linking to administrative data from other sources.
