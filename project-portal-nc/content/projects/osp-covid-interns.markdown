deliverable: |+
  - In 2020 and 2021, the NC COVID-19 Student Response Corps placed 194 students in internships at 110+ nonprofit and government organizations across nearly 50 counties.
  - Lead for NC/UNC School of Government and OSP co-led two days of training and education sessions to prepare interns for their placements as well as a weekly speaker series. Speakers from institutions of higher education, nonprofits, philanthropy, and government shared experience and expertise. More than 300 interns from Response Corps and other North Carolina internship/fellowship programs participated in these opportunities. [Click here](https://lfnc.sog.unc.edu/fellows/training-resources/) for recordings of the training and speaker series. These videos are a valuable resource for students and others interested in learning about North Carolina state and local government, nonprofit organizations, careers in public service, and philanthropy.
summary: |+
  The NC Office of Strategic Partnerships (OSP) and Lead for NC/The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) School of Government, in collaboration with many partners, launched the NC COVID-19 Student Response Corps in May 2020. The Response Corps helps match students with internships in government and nonprofit organizations to support COVID-19 response and other efforts. The initiative included a two-day training and speaker series attended by hundreds of interns from the Response Corps and other North Carolina internship and fellowship programs.
