  Guilford County Health Department, North Carolina
statusOfData: |+
  The project team is collecting wastewater samples from various Guilford County school zone sites, selected based on poverty level and vaccination rates.
slug: wastewater-covid-19
topics: 
  - COVID-19
purpose: |+
  Project partners can use the data to provide guidance for how to address the inequality and disproportionate burden of the pandemic on underserved populations. They can also maintain the surveillance system and continue to develop the partnership as a model for future infectious disease emergency action preparedness and surveillance.
question: |+
  What is the relationship between spatiotemporal epidemic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater, vaccine efficacy in school zones, and prolonged COVID-19 burdens?
startDate: 2022-01-01
fundingInfo: |+
  OSP is providing funding for this project to support a graduate student. The NC Policy Collaboratory is supporting this project with in-kind contributions of a qPCR machine for the duration of the study and relevant equipment training.
deliverable: |+
  - Weekly project reports detailing wastewater COVID-19 concentration findings and student involvement.
  - Final presentation on project findings.
summary: |+
  The study - a research and engagement partnership - aims toÂ  fill critical scientific knowledge gaps in exposure science and the relationship between spatiotemporal epidemic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater, vaccine efficacy in school zones, and prolonged COVID-19 burdens, three areas of public health importance. Anticipated results could be significant for populations impacted by environmental injustice and differentially burdened by SARS-CoV-2 in heavily occupied and variably vaccinated urban school zones and neighborhoods.
