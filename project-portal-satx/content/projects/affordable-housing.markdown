deliverable: |+
  - An automated process of merging the affordable housing data from multiple sources to the dashboard created by ITSD (Information & Technology Services Department) for display to the public. By developing an automated method, data can be compiled from various partner organizations into one pipeline so that the information can be readily displayed on the dashboard.
summary: |+
  San Antonioâ€™s Affordable Housing dashboard is a visualization of what the City and its partners are doing to meet local affordable housing needs. The dashboard includes a mapped inventory of all affordable housing, and it's searchable by provider, housing type, council district, funding source, and more.

  The goal for this project is to automate the data aggregating process to improve the accuracy, precision, and currency of the data compilation while reducing the processing time and labor.
