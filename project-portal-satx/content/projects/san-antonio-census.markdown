  - Guidance on survey instrument design to include and standard operating procedures, tools, and resources for COSA survey instruments and research (including how to best ask and evaluate open-ended questions).Â  The guidance will also include strategies that can be employed to increase response rates to surveys. The guide will be designed to support the novice survey developer and will be written using simple non-jargon terminology.
summary: |+
  The City of San Antonio conducts several community surveys every year that are meant to be used for strategic planning and data-informed decision making.

  Most of these surveys are conducted with no statistical or demographical expertise. Therefore, in many cases:
  - The sample size is not statistically significant and/or
  - The respondent demographic segmentation is not representative of the target audience and, as a result, the results might not be statistically representative and should not be used for strategic purposes.

  The goal of this project is to create standard operating procedures, tools, and resources for CoSA survey instruments and research (including how to best ask and evaluate open-ended questions).
