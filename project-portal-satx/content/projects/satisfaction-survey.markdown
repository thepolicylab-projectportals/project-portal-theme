summary: |+
  311 helps residents improve city neighborhoods by empowering them to report non-emergency related issues like potholes, graffiti, animal cruelty, and more using their phone, a mobile app, or a web app. The customer service office has a survey that asks 311 users how satisfied they were with the 311 experience. This feedback helps the 311 office improve their services.

  We want to improve response rates for the satisfaction survey. Ideally, we would see 200-300 responses per month and we’d like to understand how to better target our audience.  We also want to test better ways to get feedback, which could include improving our questions, shortening the survey, or even issuing the survey over text. This project will evaluate existing survey design and propose a modified set of survey instruments for higher level of clarity and improved survey experience.
