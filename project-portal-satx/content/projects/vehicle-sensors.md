slug: vehicle-sensors
topics: Technology Streets and Sidewalks
purpose: - Reduce calls to 311 service.\n- Create efficiencies. \n- Identify neglected areas of town where there are issues that no one is calling about and/or help inform allocation of resources.
question: Can sensors on City vehicles identify and collect real-time data on the City’s infrastructure and areas of service needed?
deliverable: - Algorithms that detect potholes and road degradation on San Antonio roads.\n- [Final Report](https://www.sanantonio.gov/Portals/0/Files/Innovation/RDLeague/Projects/SWMDVehiclesSensors.pdf).\n
summary: Sensors were retrofitted onto a Solid Waste Management Department (SWMD) truck to test the reliability, usefulness, and efficiency of utilizing sensors on city vehicles to proactively plan pothole repair routes. This was a starting point for over 30 potential infrastructure use cases. SwRI’s camera/lidar platform is reliable and low-cost compared to emerging vendor solutions other cities are dependent on. \n\nThe sensor platform has been tested and adjusted to include a more user-friendly, one-button solution for SWMD drivers & more precise cameras for informing AI algorithms. Not enough potholes were available to build robust AI algorithms, so the focus for a further phase will be on identifying the next use case(s) and testing whether SWMD jeeps will be a more efficient/effective mobile sensor platform than garbage trucks.\n
