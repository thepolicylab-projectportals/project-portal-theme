deliverable: - [A report and presentation of results](https://www.sanantonio.gov/Portals/0/Files/Innovation/RDLeague/Projects/COSATTATrial3.pdf).\n
summary: This trial attempted to test whether prizes would incentivize higher participation in workshops hosted by the Parks and Neighborhood and Services Department to promote summer safety. The City of San Antonio tested two different messages – one with a gift bag prize, one without – that were sent to over 1900 residents and community groups throughout the city via email. This trial did not yield statistically relevant findings, however, the outcomes did provide insights that will inform future trials. \n
