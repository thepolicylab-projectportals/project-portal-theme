slug: artificial-intelligence
topics: Public Safety Transportation Streets and Sidewalks
purpose: - Stakeholders will gain a better understanding of the issues that lead to traffic accidents.  \n- Outcomes will empower stakeholders to plan smarter, safer streets and pedestrian features.  \n- Sufficient data will be available to replace existing stand-alone roadway data collection efforts to save taxpayer dollars. \n- Vision Zero can use the data from this project to make informed decisions and proactively determine the allocation of resources and ensure equitable and targeted improvements. 
question: Can we apply artificial intelligence to traffic camera feeds to give us a deeper understanding of the conditions that lead to traffic accidents?
startDate: 2022-04-01
deliverable: - Relevant data and evidence-based recommendations for making informed programming decisions by the Transportation Department.\n- Relevant data and evidence-based recommendations to enable the Public Works team  to proactively determine the allocation of resources and ensure equitable and targeted infrastructure improvements.\n- A process for providing sufficient data to replace existing stand-alone roadway data collection efforts to save taxpayer dollars.\n- Documentation necessary for stakeholders to use relevant Active-Vision user interfaces and to understand the data available from the system.\n
summary: We believe artificial intelligence (AI) on city traffic camera feeds will: (1) provide the City and key stakeholders a better understanding of the issues that lead to traffic accidents; (2) empower stakeholders to plan smarter, safer streets and pedestrian features; and (3) provide sufficient data to replace existing stand-alone roadway data collection efforts to save taxpayer dollars. \n\nThis trial establishes a pilot zone to apply artificial intelligence (AI) to traffic camera feeds, using SwRI’s ActiveVision system, to extract data from a subset of traffic camera video feeds. It will extract vehicle and pedestrian traffic patterns across extended periods of time to build better solutions to address accidents and fatalities.\n
