question: Which communication channel will generate more interest in Train for Jobs SA?
deliverable: - [A report and presentation of results](https://www.sanantonio.gov/Portals/0/Files/Innovation/RDLeague/Projects/COSATTATrial1.pdf).\n
summary: We evaluated the effectiveness of two communication channels —text message vs. postcard—to encourage residents to apply to a jobs training program, Train for Jobs SA. We contacted over 30,000 applicants to the COVID-19 Emergency Housing Assistance (EHAP) who were likely to have experienced job and/or income loss due to the pandemic. Residents who were randomly assigned to receive texts were 50% more likely to call 311 than the residents who received a postcard. At this response rate, texts ($18/text) were significantly more cost-effective than postcards ($220/postcard).\n\n
