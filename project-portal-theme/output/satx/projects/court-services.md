deliverable: - A list of best practices for court processes and service delivery gathered from a review of current literature and analyses of the existing court survey and internal case tracking system data.\n
summary: This project focuses on the determinants of failures to appear (FTA), and a need to explore best practices in reaching or communicating with FTAs, as well as preferences for case resolution. \n\nThe court has experienced much higher FTA rates during the COVID-19 pandemic. In general, marginalized or disadvantaged persons experience court outcomes that are more punitive due to missed court dates, prolonged case times due to resets, etc., not necessarily because their cases are more serious but because they lack the time, knowledge and/or access to necessary court information to resolve their case in a timely and satisfactory manner. This may have become even more pronounced in the last two years due to loss of employment, housing, and/or illnesses exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\nThis project will assist the CoSA Municipal Court in fulfilling their mission to serve all populations with necessary court services and in delivery of just and equitable outcomes for all.\n
