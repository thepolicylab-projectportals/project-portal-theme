        "text": "The North Carolina Office of Strategic Partnerships (OSP) develops, launches, and enhances partnerships between state government and NC's research and philanthropic sectors. This includes elevating state government's internal capacity to use and generate evidence in its policy and programmatic functions.\n\nTo further facilitate this work, OSP is piloting the NC Project Portal to share state agency research needs and to empower people with a way to express interest in partnering to work on those needs.\n\nIf you are interested in working on a project, please connect. OSP seeks partners from a wide range of disciplines, reflecting the fact that needs are varied as are the backgrounds and expertise needed to address those needs. Where possible, project summaries include information about what types of expertise are likely needed but if you have an idea for how to contribute that is different or not stated in the summary, please let us know.\n\nAfter OSP collects expressions of interest, agency partners, research partners, and OSP work together to determine fit and how to best approach the project. OSP prioritizes partnerships that are scalable, sustainable, and develop public, open-source resources.\n\nTo learn more about how OSP facilitates cross-sector partnerships, watch the [Monthly Connect: North Carolina Office of Strategic Partnerships Information and Resources](https://ncosbm.sharefile.com/share/view/sef84169b1fcc4e008710fcaa118f1ee0) and visit the [OSP website](https://www.osbm.nc.gov/operational-excellence/nc-office-strategic-partnerships)."

        "title": "Do I need to have prior experience working with government?",
        "text": "No. We hope that the NC Project Portal encourages people who have not worked with government to consider doing so. OSP can help you understand what makes for a good partnership and how it may be different (or similar) to other domains."

      {
        "title": "Are these opportunities open to students?",
        "text": "Yes, for some projects. OSP encourages student involvement and, in some cases, may be able to provide support for their participation on a project. Ultimately the needs of the agency (which vary project to project) along with research partner input, determine what type of expertise will fit best for each project partnership. The project description will usually state if specific experience is required. If you're a student interested in a project, we encourage you to express your interest even if you're unsure whether your expertise is a good fit."

      {
        "title": "Can multiple people or organizations work on a project?",
        "text": "Yes. Needs vary from project to project with respect to expertise needed, project scope, timeline, and other factors. Each project summary page describes expectations and requirements for that project. When appropriate and feasible, OSP encourages people within or across organizations to work collaboratively. If you are interested in working with one or more collaborators but have not identified those collaborators, please contact OSP at [partnerships@osbm.nc.gov](mailto:partnerships@osbm.nc.gov)."
      },
      {
        "title": "Is there funding for projects?",
        "text": "It depends. Project needs and the availability of funding (if needed) vary from project to project and are likely to depend on scope, deliverables, expertise needed, and other factors. OSP, agency partners, and research partners work together to determine if a project has costs, what funding may be available, and possibilities for pursuing funding, if needed."

      {
        "title": "What kind of data are available?",
        "text": "It depends. Projects with data components may involve qualitative and quantitative data. Data may already be collected or it may need to be collected. OSP, agency partners, and research partners work together to assess what data would advance a project and, in turn, whether and how to collect and share it."

If you have a project idea, please email [partnerships@osbm.nc.gov](mailto:partnerships@osbm.nc.gov) with a brief description of your proposed project. The description should include, at a minimum, a project overview, how the results would benefit North Carolinians, and an estimated timeline."
